The beauty of Web3 is that everyone owns their data, but accessing and displaying own data is a difficult thing. Each application has its own data specifications and access methods, it's hard for developers to adapt to all of them one by one. That's why Unidata 💡🧶.

Unidata gets data from a variety of platforms and data sources on the front end, converts it to the same and easy-to-use specifications, and gives developers a unified API to access it. Web3 development has never been so easy.

Unidata classifies data into four categories:

-   👾 Profiles record the basic information of accounts, including the name, avatar, bio, connected accounts, etc.
-   🕸 Links describe the relationships between accounts, such as following relationship.
-   💎 Assets are the properties owned by accounts, such as an NFT, a game achievement, a physical figure, a commodity for sale, etc.
-   🎼 Notes are the actions or events generated by accounts, such as writing a blog post, getting a NFT dynamic, donation to others, etc.
