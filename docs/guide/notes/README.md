# Overview

<Logos type="Notes" />

Notes are the actions or events generated by accounts, such as writing a blog post, getting a NFT dynamic, donation to others, etc.

You can initialize with `ipfsGateway` to potentially get a faster response or higher stability.

## API

```ts
const notes: Notes = await unidata.notes.get(options: {
    source: string;
    identity: string;
    limit?: number;
    cursor?: any;
});
```

-   `identity`: Ethereum address, Solana address, Flow address, etc.
-   `limit`: The number of assets to return. Since providers use different pagination schemes, there is no guarantee that the quantities are always accurate.
-   `cursor`: The pagination cursor returned from the previous page's results. Since providers use different pagination schemes, the type is uncertain.

## Specification

All returned data conform to the following specification.

```ts
type Notes = {
    total: number;
